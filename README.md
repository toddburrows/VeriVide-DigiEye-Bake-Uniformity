# VeriVide DigiEye Bake Uniformity
A project I completed on my 4 week summer placement with VeriVide Ltd. The project title is Bake Uniformity and it involves an image, that is taken with VeriVide's DigiEye technology, being processed and the level of which the baked good is cooked across the image is inspected producing several representations to show the uniformity and distribution of the bake. This technology and software can then be used to test how even the heating is of cooking appliances such as ovens, air fryers, microwaves or pressure cookers.

## Outcome

## The Assignment Abstract
There had been requests from customers of VeriVide Ltd for their DigiEye software to provide details about the colour uniformity of their baked goods. An automated solution that would describe the bake distribution across the baked good would provide the customer with a valuable insight into the quality of the current baking process. A solution that would be able to segment an image and group similar colour values together into regions in order to provide the customer with a description of the spatial breakdown of these regions in an easily digestable way meant that the customer would be able to focus on business-critical areas as opposed to having to annotate the image themselves, which was the current solution. Also a software based solution would ensure that the process was repeatable and eliminate the chance of human error.

## My Objectives
1) Read an image that has been taken with VeriVide's DigiEye technology and process the data in order to segment the image and calculate the level of bake for each region across the baked good.
2) Group similar colour values together using k-means clustering to section the baked good into 3 distinct groups - 'under', 'good' and 'over' cooked.
3) Describe the uniformity and distribution of the bake using a variety of easily digestable visual representations of the level of bake across the baked good.
