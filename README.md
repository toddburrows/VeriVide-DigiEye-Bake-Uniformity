# VeriVide DigiEye Bake Uniformity
 A project I completed on my 4 week summer placement with VeriVide Ltd. The project title is Bake Uniformity and it involves an image, that is taken with VeriVide's DigiEye technology, being processed and the level of which the cake is cooked across the image is inspected producing several representations to show the uniformity and distribution of the bake. This technology and software can then be used to test how even the heating is of cooking appliances such as ovens, air fryers, microwaves or pressure cookers.
